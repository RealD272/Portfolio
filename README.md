# Portfolio
A portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript serves as a personal or professional website to showcase skills, projects, and experiences. It typically includes a homepage with a welcoming introduction and navigation links to different sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, Resume, and Contact. The About Me section provides a brief introduction, background, and career aspirations. The Skills section highlights technical abilities through progress bars or interactive elements, while the Projects section showcases completed work with descriptions, images, and links to demos or GitHub repositories. A Resume section allows visitors to download or view the CV, and the Contact section includes a form or links to social media. With JavaScript, the portfolio can have dynamic elements like animations, interactive buttons, and smooth scrolling, enhancing user engagement and making the website visually appealing.
